# evolvability

`evovability` is an R-package for calculating evolvability parameters from G-matrices (see Hansen and Houle 2008  <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01573.x> and Bolstad et al. 2014 <https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2013.0255>) and for fitting phylogenetic comparative models that link the rate of evolution of a trait to the state of another evolving trait (see Hansen et al. 2021 Systematic Biology <https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syab079>).

The package includes two vignettes. One on analyzing rates of evolution and one on fitting phylogenetic mixed models.

The latest version of the package can be downloaded by `devtools::install_github(repo = "GHBolstad/evolvability", build_vignettes = TRUE)`
