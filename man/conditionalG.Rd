\title{Computing a conditional sub-matrix of G}
\usage{
conditionalG(G, condition_on = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{A variance matrix (must be symmetric and positive definite).}

\item{condition_on}{Either an integer with the column number indicating which
trait to condition on or a vector with several column numbers (integers).}
}
\value{
A matrix that is a sub-matrix of the input matrix conditional on the
  non-included traits.
}
\description{
\code{conditinoalG} calculates a conditional variance matrix.
}
\details{
The function calculates a sub-matrix of \code{G} conditional on the
  traits defined by the the \code{condition_on} vector. The function is based
  on equation 3 in Hansen et al. (2003).
}
\examples{
# Constructing a G-matrix:
G <- matrix(c(
  1, 1, 0, 1,
  1, 2, 1, 1,
  0, 1, 2, 1,
  1, 1, 1, 3
), ncol = 4)

# Computing a conditional 2x2 sub-matrix by conditioning on
# trait 3 and 4:
G_sub_conditional <- conditionalG(G, condition_on = c(3, 4))
G_sub_conditional

# The average evolvabilities of this matrix can then be
# compared can than be compared to the average evolvabilities
# of the corresponding unconditional sub-matrix of G:
evolvabilityMeans(G_sub_conditional)
evolvabilityMeans(G[-c(3, 4), -c(3, 4)])
